🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a digital version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players compete against each other. It's simple, fun, and a great way to practice your programming skills! 🚀

🎯 Project Overview

🕹️ Game Rules

Grid Layout: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, consisting of 9 squares.
Objective: The goal is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.
Turns: Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty square.
Winning: The first player to get three in a row wins! 🏆
Draw: If all squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw. 🤝
